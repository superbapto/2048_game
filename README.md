# 2048_game
This code will allow you to play a game of 2048 from the terminal from scratch or from an exisiting grid.

Run the terminal, find the location of the code and launch it.
At first, it will ask you to enter your initial configuration file. You can either enter a file name with an already made grid and press eany character and ENTER to create a new one.
A new 4x4 grid will be created and is ready to play in the terminal and a new grid will appear every time you move. 

HOW TO PLAY:
- Play with the WASD keys and press ENTER to move around
- Try to make the biggest number possible by adding two of the same numbers together
- When you can't move in one direction, nothing will happen and the code will wait for you to make a new move.
- When you are stuck and can't make any additionnal move (grid is full with no same numbers next to each other) the game is over and you can only start over.
